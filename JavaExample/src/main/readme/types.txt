int: basic number type; NO decimal place, only whole numbers.

float: supports decimal places. Requires that you format numbers as x.xf eg. 4.0f

double: like float but a little slower with more accuracy.
Does not require the unique formatting. Use float if possible.

String: any combination of letters. Will mostly be used for printing to
the console or driver hub telemetry.

void: The absence of a type. Generally speaking, this means that the object
that has a void type also has no value. Mostly used to show that a method
will not return anything.

boolean: has two values, true or false.
Is most commonly outputted by logic operators/methods (== or .isEqual())
Also used for logic switches.
